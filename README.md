# RandomForestsRegressor-Insurance
A PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS of a Insurance Dataset using RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR

It consist of the Random Forest Regressor together with the evaluation aspects in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MSE. This project aims to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model on a given dataset. Linear regression is a popular method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is 


Which contains information about the customer details. The dataset includes 10000 instances and 13 attributes including the CreditScore of customers registered.

Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the linear regression model will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2).

MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.  R2 measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

Results

The results of the evaluation will be presented in a Jupyter Notebook, including visualizations of the data and the performance metrics. The notebook will also include a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the linear regression model and suggestions for future improvements.

Therefore the results i found out is that there was  low R-Squared value meaning that the linear regression function line does not fit the data well.
Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
